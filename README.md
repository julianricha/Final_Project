# Final_Project
Final Project of Julian and Bader

Project Topic: Food Ordering App 
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Python application that leverages a food ordering system that allows users to order food from the menu of the restaurant of their choice, be able to track their order such as estimated delivery time with traffic taken into account based on location, breakdown of order cost, and be able to apply to an optional membership offered by the app for discounts. The application will utilize object oriented programming and inheritance for both restaurants and user functionality, and will be using a graphical user interface to provide a friendly and dynamic interaction with the user. The primary objective is to build a user-friendly and efficient app for users of different locations and appetites to order food online through delivery, while having the option of using a monthly membership to have users be excluded from delivery fees, services fees, tax fees, and be able to apply discounts.

Project Objectives: 
- To develop a Python application that allows users to order food through delivery, have a breakdown of the order cost, estimated delivery time, and apply for an optional membership for discounts and price cuts
- Implement object oriented programming and inheritance for restaurants and user functionalities
- Create a graphical user interface for the ordering process and display full order with info to the user

Deliverables: 
- A fully functional Python application of a food ordering system 
- A report detailing the program's efficiency and behavior with orders from different restaurants. 
- A project presentation that summarizes the project's objectives, development process,  challenges encountered, and learning outcomes.


Document Basic Functionalities 
- User Interaction: Ability to allow users to choose from a variety of restaurants and add items to the cart based on the restaurants menu
- Customizable Order: Allow users to customize orders based on chosen restaurant and be able to calculate the cost of the customizable order. A customizable order can be creating an order from scratch, or choosing stuff like toppings to a specific order, rather than just having to choose from a menu and adding to cart
- Total Cost: Display a total breakdown of order cost based on user menu choices, sizes, and other fees.
- Membership: Allow users to opt in for an optional membership to be accountable for possible discounts and price cuts
- GUI: Have a graphical user interface for the ordering process to have a dynamic and interactive experience for the user.
- Delivery time: Based on both restaurantâ€™s location and user location, we can display not only the delivery time, but also account for possible traffic that might delay an order
