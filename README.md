Final Project of Julian and Bader

Document Basic Functionalities
- Graph Creation: Ability to create a graph with nodes and edges. Users should be able to input or generate graphs with weights representing distances or costs.
- Input Handling: Process input graphs either from user input, file uploads, or generated examples within the code. Ensure flexibility in how graphs can be inputted into the system.
- Pathfinding Interface: A user interface to select start and end nodes for which the shortest path is to be found.
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm Implementation: The core functionality where Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes.
- Path Visualization: Display the shortest path visually on the graph, possibly highlighting the path in a different color or showing step-by-step path selection.
- Performance Analysis: Provide analysis on the algorithm's performance, such as computation time and efficiency, especially for large graphs.
- Error Handling and Validation: Ensure that the code gracefully handles errors and validates input to avoid crashes or incorrect outputs.
